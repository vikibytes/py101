Question:
Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. 
The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically. 
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1

Convert a list which contains the numbers 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3, and convert it to a tuple a.
Convert a to a list b. Print its length.
Convert b to a set c. Print its length.
Convert c to a list d. Print its length.
Create a range which starts at 1 and ends at 10. Convert it to a list e.
Create the directory dict from the previous example. Create a list t which contains all the key-value pairs from the dictionary as tuples.
Create a list v of all the values in the dictionary.
Create a list k of all the keys in he dictionary.
Create a string s which contains the word "antidisestablishmentarianism". Use the sorted function on it. What is the output type? Concatenate the letters in the output to a string s2.
Split the string "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" into a list w of individual words.

Question:

#. Create a dict ``directory`` which stores telephone numbers (as string values), and populate it with these key-value pairs:

   ==========  ================
   Name        Telephone number
   ==========  ================
   Jane Doe    +27 555 5367
   John Smith  +27 555 6254
   Bob Stone   +27 555 5689
   ==========  ================

#. Change Jane's number to *+27 555 1024*
#. Add a new entry for a person called *Anna Cooper* with the phone number *+27 555 3237*
#. Print Bob's number.
#. Print Bob's number in such a way that ``None`` would be printed if Bob's name were not in the dictionary.
#. Print all the keys. The format is unimportant, as long as they're all visible.
#. Print all the values.
